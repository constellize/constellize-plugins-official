<task>
Create team onboarding plan for $0 ($1) to adopt memory banks by developing practical exercises for first experiences, structuring gradual introduction from minimal to full system, creating shared vocabulary and conventions, setting up collaborative practices, addressing common concerns and objections, measuring early adoption success—enabling team-wide memory bank adoption with minimal friction and maximum early wins.

Team: $0
Size: $1
Timeline: $2
Documentation: $3

Successful team adoption requires more than introducing a tool or process. It requires:
1. Hands-on experience (learn by doing, not by reading)
2. Gradual complexity increase (start minimal, build mastery)
3. Shared understanding (team aligned on vocabulary, conventions)
4. Early wins (momentum and confidence)
5. Clear value demonstration (why this helps)
6. Addressing real concerns (not dismissing objections)

Connects to Chapter 9 theme of practical adoption—from curiosity to competence through guided practice.
</context>

<thinking>
Before onboarding team:
1. What's team's current knowledge level?
2. What are team's main concerns about memory banks?
3. How to build confidence through early wins?
4. What minimal viable memory bank to start with?
5. How to transition from minimal to comprehensive system?
6. What shared conventions needed for collaboration?
7. How to measure adoption success?
8. What obstacles to anticipate?

## Onboarding Phases Pattern

```
## Phase 1: Kickoff and Shared Vocabulary

**Duration:** 1 week

### Kickoff Workshop (2 hours)

Agenda:
1. Memory banks overview: What, why, how (30 min)
   - Show example memory bank (existing or template)
   - Demonstrate how it helps developers
   - Address team's specific concerns

2. Plan-prompt-proceed pattern walkthrough (30 min)
   - Demonstrate pattern with real example
   - Show how memory bank feeds each stage
   - Why pattern helps

3. Shared conventions discussion (45 min)
   - Document organization: How should we structure ours?
   - File naming: How do we name files?
   - Format conventions: Markdown structure?
   - Update process: Who, when, how?
   - Q&A: Address team questions

4. First steps preview (15 min)
   - Show minimal memory bank we're starting with
   - Timeline: When you'll be using this
   - Support: Who to ask for help

### Shared Conventions Document

Create team-specific conventions:
- Document organization (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, etc.)
- File naming (kebab-case, .md extension, etc.)
- Format conventions (headings, code blocks, cross-references)
- Update process (who can update, when, how to review)
- Example files showing conventions applied

Activity: Have team review conventions, suggest adjustments, agree together.

---

## Phase 2: Hands-On Minimal Adoption

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### Week 1: Create Minimal Memory Bank

Activity: Create team's first memory bank with only 2 files:

1. **systemPatterns.md**: Key architectural decisions and patterns
   - Keep it minimal (5-10 patterns max)
   - Include: What, why, when to use, examples
   - Activity: Team brainstorms together, one person drafts, team reviews

2. **techContext.md**: Current technical decisions and assumptions
   - Keep it minimal (key technologies, versions, important context)
   - Activity: Junior engineer leads with senior helping
   - Benefit: Junior learns system context, senior learns what's implicit

### Week 2: Experience Minimal Memory Bank

Activity: Use memory bank in 2-3 real development tasks

During these tasks:
1. Before starting task: Team member checks memory bank for relevant context
2. During task: Team member references memory bank documentation
3. After task: Team member updates memory bank if needed

Reflection after week:
- Was memory bank helpful?
- What was missing?
- How could it be better?
- What should we add next?

---

## Phase 3: Structured Expansion

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### Adding Documentation Based on Needs

Don't create everything upfront. Add docs when they're needed:

Week 1: Team identifies gaps discovered in Phase 2
- Did you need info about X? (If yes, write techContext section about X)
- Do we have pattern for Y? (If no, document systemPatterns section about Y)
- What operational knowledge should we capture? (Add operations/ section)

Week 2: Team creates additional sections based on identified needs
- Don't create everything at once
- Create docs when team needs them (need-driven growth)
- Team practices: Ask "Is this in memory bank?" before rediscovering

### Practicing Plan-Prompt-Proceed

Team tries pattern on 2-3 real features:

Feature implementation flow:
1. **Plan**: Team examines memory bank, creates context for prompt
2. **Prompt**: Using memory bank context, create detailed prompt
3. **Proceed**: AI assists with implementation, team refines

Reflection after trying pattern:
- Did memory bank help planning?
- Did AI understand problem better with context?
- Were results better with memory bank than without?

---

## Phase 4: Team Practices and Sustainability

**Duration:** Ongoing after onboarding

### Weekly Practices

Establish sustainable practices:
- Sprint planning: What memory bank updates needed this sprint?
- After sprint: Quick learning capture (30 minutes)
- Code review: Does change need memory bank update?
- Problem solving: Check memory bank first, contribute learning after

### Monthly Review

Monthly (every 4 weeks):
- Review memory bank health (is it current, useful, organized?)
- Team retrospective: How's adoption going? What's working? What's hard?
- Adjust practices if needed

### Resistance Points and Solutions

If team resists memory bank:

Resistance 1: "Takes too long to document"
- Solution: Start with very minimal entries, iterate
- Show ROI: Time saved by having context vs. rediscovering

Resistance 2: "Documentation gets stale"
- Solution: Make updates part of normal work (code review checklist)
- Link to failing tests: If test fails, update docs

Resistance 3: "We don't know what to document"
- Solution: Document when someone asks a question
- If you had to ask, others will too

```

### Examples
Every technical entry should include:
- Real example from codebase
- When to use it
- When not to use it

```

## Early Wins Strategy

```
## Designing for Early Wins

Early wins build momentum and confidence. Plan activities that show value quickly:

### Win 1: Solve Recent Problem Using Memory Bank

Example: "Last sprint, we had a bug related to circuit breaker thresholds. We documented that learning. This sprint, when new team member asked about circuit breaker tuning, they found the answer in memory bank in 2 minutes instead of us spending 30 minutes explaining."

Activity: Show how memory bank solved actual problem.

### Win 2: Improve Onboarding for New Team Member

Use memory bank to onboard someone new:
- New engineer reads systemPatterns.md and techContext.md (2-3 hours)
- New engineer gets context that used to take 1-2 days of pair programming
- Show before/after: How much faster onboarding with memory bank?

### Win 3: Speed Up Feature Planning

Demonstrate: Planning complex feature using memory bank vs. without
- With memory bank: Found relevant patterns, tech context, decision history (fast)
- Without: Rediscovering same patterns and decisions (slow)
- Show time saved

### Win 4: Catch Design Issues Early

Example: Code review where engineer checked memory bank before implementing
- Found existing pattern that applied
- Avoided reimplementing same thing differently
- Saved implementation and maintenance time

```

- Checked systemPatterns.md#circuit-breaker (found existing pattern)
- Used documented thresholds instead of guessing
- Result: Implementation faster, more confident in thresholds

Feature 2: Jordan investigating payment webhook issue
- Checked techContext.md#stripe-api (found webhook structure docs)
- Quickly understood issue, fixed in 1 hour vs. 3 hours without docs
- Result: Faster debugging

Feature 3: Casey reviewing payment validation code
- Checked systemPatterns.md#validation-result (found pattern)
- Code followed existing pattern, review easier
- Result: Consistent approach team-wide

### Team Reflection (Feb 5)

Results:
- Everyone used memory bank at least once
- Memory bank was helpful for 3/4 features
- Missing: Operational runbooks for common payment issues
- Enthusiasm: "This would have saved me time last month"

Decision: Add operations/ section with payment troubleshooting guide next.

## Phase 3-4: Sustainable Practices

Monthly review:
- Updates per sprint: 5-7 updates (healthy level)
- Team satisfaction: 4.2/5 average ("useful and current")
- New team member onboarded in 0.5 day using memory bank

```

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Team onboarding isn't about adoption rate or compliance. It's about helping team experience value.

DO NOT:
- Make it mandatory ("You have to use memory bank")
- Create everything upfront (team won't use what they didn't create)
- Overload team in Week 1 (start minimal)
- Skip addressing objections (listen to concerns)
- Treat as one-time training (ongoing practice needed)

ALWAYS:
- Start with hands-on experience (learn by doing)
- Plan for early wins (show value quickly)
- Build team shared understanding (align on conventions)
- Start minimal and grow based on need (not theory)
- Address real obstacles (make it easy to adopt)
- Measure adoption (track progress)
- Celebrate milestones (build momentum)

REMEMBER: Best adoptions start with "wow, this saves me time" not "we have a process." Engineer the early experience to create that moment.
