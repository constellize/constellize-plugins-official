<task>
Assess operational memory bank health for $0 by evaluating operational memory bank currency (are runbooks accurate?), checking cross-reference integrity between operational and development knowledge, identifying knowledge gaps (missing runbooks, undocumented failure modes), assessing incident response effectiveness using knowledge, measuring time-to-resolution trends, recommending knowledge updates based on recent incidents.
</task>

<context>
System: $0
Assessment Scope: $1
Time Period: $2
Memory Bank Structure: $3

Operational memory banks decay without maintenance: runbooks become outdated as systems evolve, cross-references break as documents move, knowledge gaps emerge as new failure modes appear. Regular health assessments identify decay before it impacts incident response, ensuring operational knowledge remains accurate and actionable.

Assessment differs from ad-hoc updates:
- Ad-hoc: Update specific document after specific incident
- Assessment: Systematic review of entire operational knowledge base for currency, completeness, effectiveness

Both are necessary for knowledge health.
</context>

<thinking>
Before assessing operational knowledge:
1. When was operational knowledge last comprehensively reviewed?
2. How many incidents occurred since last assessment?
3. Have incidents revealed knowledge gaps?
4. Are runbooks being used effectively during incidents?
5. Are cross-references still valid?
6. Have system architectures evolved since documentation?
7. Are incident resolution times trending up or down?
</thinking>

Next assessment date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Operational knowledge decays without regular maintenance. Systematic health assessments catch decay before it impacts incident response.

DO NOT:
- Wait for incidents to reveal knowledge gaps (proactive assessment prevents issues)
- Assess without testing (verify runbook commands actually work)
- Skip cross-reference validation (broken links frustrate responders)
- Ignore resolution time trends (early warning of knowledge degradation)
- Create assessment without action plan (assessment without action is wasted effort)
- Assess in isolation (involve on-call engineers who use knowledge)

ALWAYS:
- Test runbook commands in non-prod (don't assume they still work)
- Validate cross-references automatically (broken links decay quickly)
- Analyze incident trends (what gaps do incidents reveal?)
- Measure resolution time correlation with knowledge availability
- Prioritize gap closure by impact (SEV-1 scenarios first)
- Create actionable recommendations with owners and dates
- Schedule next assessment (quarterly recommended for critical systems)
- Involve on-call engineers in assessment (they know what's missing)

REMEMBER: Operational knowledge is infrastructure. Like any infrastructure, it requires regular maintenance to remain reliable. Assessment without action is theater; assessment with prioritized action prevents future incident pain.

## Domain 4: Incident Response Effectiveness

### Runbook Usage Analysis

#### Incidents Using Runbooks (3 incidents)

| Incident | Runbook Used | Effective? | Time Saved | Gaps Found |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2026-01-15-db-conn | database-connection-failure.md | ✓ Yes | ~10-15 min | None (runbook perfect) |
| 2026-01-20-api-latency | performance-degradation.md | ⚠ Partial | ~5 min | Missing APM investigation step |
| 2026-01-10-deployment-issue | deployment-procedures.md | ✗ No | 0 min | Runbook outdated (Helm migration) |

Runbook effectiveness:
- ✓ Highly effective: 1 (33%)
- ⚠ Partially effective: 1 (33%)
- ✗ Not effective: 1 (33%)

Time saved by runbooks:
- Total time saved: 15-20 minutes across 3 incidents
- Average time saved per incident: ~7 minutes
- Value: Effective runbooks save 10-15 minutes per incident

Runbook improvements identified:
1. performance-degradation.md: Add APM investigation procedure (gap found in 2026-01-20)
2. deployment-procedures.md: Complete rewrite for Helm (so outdated it wasn't useful in 2026-01-10)

---

#### Incidents Without Runbooks (2 incidents)

| Incident | Scenario | Severity | Time to Resolve | Runbook Needed? |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2026-01-25-auth-503 | Upstream dependency failure (AuthService) | SEV-1 | 60 min | ✓ Yes (critical) |
| 2026-01-18-cache-invalidation | Cache invalidation failures | SEV-2 | 45 min | ✓ Yes (important) |

Impact of missing runbooks:
- Average resolution time with runbook: 30 minutes (2026-01-15)
- Average resolution time without runbook: 53 minutes ((60+45)/2)
- Delta: 23 minutes additional time without runbook

New runbooks needed (prioritized):
1. Upstream dependency failures - SEV-1, quarterly frequency, 60 min avg without runbook → ~20 min with runbook (est.)
2. Cache invalidation - SEV-2, monthly frequency, 45 min avg → ~25 min with runbook (est.)

---

### Past Incident Documentation Usage

```bash
grep -r "Similar to\|Related incident" memory-bank/operations/incidents/ | wc -l
```

Result: 2 of 5 incidents (40%) referenced past incidents

Incidents referencing past incidents:
- 2026-01-20-api-latency: Referenced 2025-11-10-slow-queries (similar slow query incident)
  - Benefit: Resolution approach from past incident worked (add index)
  - Time saved: ~10 minutes (didn't have to rediscover solution)

Effectiveness of past incident references:
- Accelerated resolution: 1 incident benefited significantly
- Time saved: ~10 minutes per incident when past precedent exists

Improvement: Past incident usage is moderate (40%). Improve discoverability:
- Add incident index/search capability
- Link similar incidents more explicitly in postmortems
- Train on-call engineers to search past incidents during investigation

---

### Architecture Documentation Usage

```bash
grep -r "memory-bank/systemPatterns.md\|memory-bank/techContext.md" memory-bank/operations/incidents/ | wc -l
```

Result: 4 of 5 incidents (80%) referenced architecture

Effectiveness:
- Architecture context helped: 3 incidents (understanding system behavior, connection pool design, dependency relationships)
- Architecture revealed assumptions: 1 incident (connection leak violated design assumption about try-with-resources)

Architecture documentation is highly valuable and well-used.

---

### Knowledge Accessibility During Incidents

□ Can on-call engineers find relevant runbooks within 1 minute?
  - Test: Simulated incident, timed runbook location
  - Result: ✓ Yes (runbooks organized by scenario, clear naming)

□ Are cross-references easy to follow?
  - Test: Followed cross-reference chain from runbook → architecture → dependencies
  - Result: ⚠ Sometimes (2 broken links found, otherwise good)

□ Is knowledge in actionable format (commands, not just concepts)?
  - Test: Reviewed runbooks for command specificity
  - Result: ✓ Yes (runbooks have specific commands with expected output)

□ Are performance baselines easy to compare against?
  - Test: During incident, how long to find baseline for metric?
  - Result: ⚠ 2-3 minutes (baselines exist but not always easy to find quickly)
  - Improvement: Add baselines to incident investigation dashboard

Overall accessibility: Good (mostly accessible, minor friction points)

Action items to improve accessibility:
1. Fix 2 broken cross-reference links - sam-patel, 2026-02-08
2. Add baselines to incident investigation dashboard - sam-patel, 2026-02-28

### Trend Drivers

Why degrading?

✗ Knowledge gaps accumulating
- 2 critical runbooks missing (dependency failures, cache invalidation)
- 1 runbook outdated and ineffective (deployment-procedures)
- 5 undocumented failure modes
- Result: 80% of incidents lacked effective runbook (4 of 5)

✗ New failure modes
- 2 novel failure modes in period (connection leak, AuthService capacity exhaustion)
- Both SEV-1, no runbooks, long resolution times

⚠ Runbook currency declining
- 1 runbook so outdated it was useless (deployment-procedures, 8 months stale)
- 1 runbook partially outdated (performance-degradation, 5 months stale)

System complexity increasing:
- New dependency (AuthService) introduced without operational knowledge
- New APM tool introduced without updating runbooks

Action items to reverse degradation:
1. Close 5 P0 knowledge gaps (expected impact: -15 minutes per SEV-1) - Various owners, 2026-02-08
2. Update 2 outdated runbooks (expected impact: -5 minutes per incident) - Various owners, 2026-02-15
3. Quarterly runbook reviews (prevent future decay) - sam-patel, ongoing

## Assessment Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Health Rating

| Domain | Rating | Key Issues | Priority Actions |
|--------|--------|------------|------------------|
| Runbook Currency | Good | 1 runbook outdated (deployment), 1 partially outdated (performance) | Rewrite deployment runbook, update performance runbook |
| Cross-Reference Integrity | Excellent | 2 broken links (minor) | Fix 2 broken links |
| Knowledge Gaps | Poor | 5 P0 gaps, 4 P1 gaps (9 total) | Close 5 P0 gaps within 1 week |
| Incident Response Effectiveness | Fair | 80% of incidents lacked effective runbook | Create 2 critical missing runbooks |
| Resolution Time Trends | Degrading | +26% slower (especially SEV-1 +50%) | Reverse degradation via gap closure |

**Overall operational knowledge health**: Fair

Overall health rating rationale:
- Currency: Good (60% current, but critical runbooks need updates)
- Cross-references: Excellent (95% valid, minor issues)
- Gaps: Poor (9 significant gaps, 5 critical)
- Effectiveness: Fair (runbooks effective when they exist, but coverage gaps)
- Trends: Degrading (resolution times increasing due to knowledge gaps)

Primary issue: Knowledge gaps accumulating faster than being closed, degrading incident response effectiveness.

### Follow-Up Schedule

Next scheduled actions:

- 1 week (2026-02-08): Review P0 critical action completion (5 actions)
- 1 month (2026-03-01): Review P1 high-priority action completion (4 actions), assess systemic improvement progress
- 1 quarter (2026-05-01): Full operational knowledge health assessment (repeat this process)

Next assessment date: 2026-05-01
```

Why this works:
- Systematic assessment across 5 domains (currency, cross-references, gaps, effectiveness, trends)
- Quantitative metrics (%, counts, time trends) not just qualitative assessment
- Evidence-based (tested runbook commands, validated links, analyzed incidents)
- Prioritized action items (P0/P1 based on severity and impact)
- Owned and dated (accountability for improvements)
- Trend analysis (detecting degradation before it's critical)
- Root cause focus (why are gaps accumulating? Why is resolution time increasing?)
- Systemic improvements (prevent future decay, not just fix current issues)

This assessment reveals:
- Operational knowledge health is Fair (degrading trend, significant gaps)
- Primary issue: Knowledge gaps accumulating (5 P0, 4 P1 gaps)
- Resolution time degrading +26% (SEV-1 +50%) due to knowledge gaps
- Runbooks effective when they exist (10-15 min time saved) but coverage gaps (80% of incidents lacked effective runbook)
- Action plan: Close 5 P0 gaps within 1 week, 4 P1 gaps within 1 month, implement systemic improvements to prevent decay

This transforms operational knowledge from reactive (fix after incident) to proactive (prevent knowledge decay).
