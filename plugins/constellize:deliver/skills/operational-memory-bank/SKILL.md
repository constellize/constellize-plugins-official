<task>
Establish operational memory bank structure for $0 by systematically assessing organizational factors, choosing between separate integrated or hybrid structure, and setting up operational knowledge foundation with clear cross-referencing strategy connecting operational and development knowledge.
</task>

<context>
Project: $0
Team Structure: $1
Team Size: $2
Existing Memory Bank: $3

Operational memory captures knowledge needed to run systems reliably: runbooks, incident reports, performance baselines, failure modes, debugging procedures, and operational dependencies. This knowledge must connect to development memory banks (system architecture, design decisions) to remain coherent as systems evolve.

**Structure Choices:**

**Separate**: operations-memory-bank/ folder distinct from memory-bank/
**Integrated**: operational knowledge within unified memory-bank/
**Hybrid**: Core platform integrated, customer-specific operations separate

Decision depends on team structure, access requirements, and how operational knowledge evolves relative to development changes.
</context>

<thinking>
Before establishing structure:
1. How do development and operations interact daily?
2. Who handles incidents (same engineers or dedicated on-call)?
3. Are there compliance/access requirements for operational details?
4. How tightly coupled are operational and development changes?
5. What operational tooling exists (incident management, observability)?
</thinking>

## Assessment Pattern

```
Factor Analysis:

TEAM STRUCTURE:
Current: [Description of dev/ops organization]
Handoffs: [Who builds → Who operates → Who fixes]

## Integrated Structure Pattern

```
memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md (includes operational overview)
├── systemPatterns.md (includes operational patterns)
├── techContext.md (includes operational technologies)
├── productContext.md
├── activeContext.md
├── progress.md
├── operations/
│   ├── runbooks/
│   │   ├── incident-response.md
│   │   ├── deployment-procedures.md
│   │   └── rollback-procedures.md

└── README.md (explains organization)

Cross-Reference Strategy:
- Direct internal references (e.g., "See operations/runbooks/deployment-procedures.md")
- Unified tagging/categorization for filtering
- Operations sections in core files reference detailed operations/ content
- Single navigation entry point
```

---

## Hybrid Structure Pattern

```
Core Platform (Integrated):
platform-service/memory-bank/
├── [Standard memory bank files]
└── operations/
    └── [Operational knowledge for platform]

Customer-Specific (Separate):
customer-a/operations-memory-bank/
├── runbooks/
├── incidents/
└── cross-references-to-platform.md

customer-b/operations-memory-bank/
├── runbooks/
├── incidents/
└── cross-references-to-platform.md

Cross-Reference Strategy:
- Customer operations reference platform memory bank
- Platform memory bank tracks customer operational impacts
- Shared operational patterns documented once in platform
- Customer-specific details isolated but connected
```

---

## Initial Setup Pattern

```
Step 1: Create Structure
[Directory tree for chosen structure]
Created: [Date]
Owner: [Team/Person]

Step 2: Establish Core Files

For Separate:
- operations-memory-bank/runbooks/incident-response-procedures.md
- operations-memory-bank/cross-references.md
- operations-memory-bank/README.md

For Integrated:
- memory-bank/operations/README.md
- memory-bank/README.md (update with operations section)
- Add operations overview to projectbrief.md

For Hybrid:
- [Core platform structure]
- [Customer template structure]
- [Cross-reference conventions document]

Step 3: Define Categories

Runbooks:
- Purpose: [Step-by-step operational procedures]
- When to create: [New service, new operational scenario]
- Naming: [Convention]

Incidents:
- Purpose: [Live incident tracking during outages]
- When to create: [Severity threshold]
- Naming: [YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md]

Postmortems:
- Purpose: [Learning from completed incidents]
- When to create: [After significant incidents]
- Naming: [YYYY-MM-DD-incident-name-postmortem.md]

Performance:
- Purpose: [Baselines, capacity planning, optimization]
- When to update: [Performance changes, capacity reviews]
- Naming: [Topic-based]

Dependencies:
- Purpose: [Service dependencies, integration points, SLOs]
- When to update: [Dependency changes, SLO reviews]
- Naming: [Topic-based]

Step 4: Cross-Reference Foundation

Development → Operations Links:
- memory-bank/systemPatterns.md → operations runbooks
- memory-bank/techContext.md → performance baselines
- Design decision docs → related incidents/postmortems

Operations → Development Links:
- Runbooks → architecture documentation
- Incidents → design decisions and constraints
- Performance data → capacity-related design choices

Bidirectional Requirements:
- Every cross-reference must exist in both directions
- Use consistent identifiers (service names, component names)
- Include brief context explaining why reference matters

Step 5: Access & Tooling

Access Control:
- [Who can read operational knowledge]
- [Who can write/update operational knowledge]
- [Special restrictions for sensitive content]

Tool Integration:
- [How incident management tools connect]
- [How monitoring tools reference knowledge]
- [How LLM assistants will query this structure]

Step 6: Validation Checklist

Structure Validation:
□ Chosen structure documented with rationale
□ Directory structure created
□ README files explain organization
□ Cross-reference strategy defined

Content Foundation:
□ At least one runbook created (incident response or deployment)
□ Incident template created
□ Postmortem template created
□ Performance baseline document initialized

Cross-References:
□ Operations references development knowledge
□ Development references operational knowledge
□ Bidirectional cross-references verified
□ Cross-reference conventions documented

Team Alignment:
□ Team understands structure choice and rationale
□ Team knows where to find operational knowledge
□ Team knows how to add new operational knowledge
□ On-call engineers can navigate structure quickly

Tool Integration:
□ Access controls configured
□ Integration with incident management planned/implemented
□ LLM assistant access configured if applicable
```

## Maintenance Pattern

```
Weekly:
- Review new incidents for knowledge gaps
- Update runbooks if procedures changed
- Check cross-reference integrity

Monthly:
- Assess operational knowledge currency
- Identify missing runbooks or scenarios
- Review and update performance baselines
- Clean up obsolete operational knowledge

Quarterly:
- Reassess structure choice (still appropriate?)
- Evaluate cross-reference effectiveness
- Review access controls and compliance
- Gather feedback from on-call engineers

Signals Structure Needs Revisiting:
- On-call engineers can't find knowledge quickly
- Frequent drift between operational and development knowledge
- Excessive cross-reference maintenance burden
- Access control conflicts
- Team structure has changed significantly
```

</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Choose structure based on actual team dynamics, not theoretical ideals.

DO NOT:
- Choose separate structure just because it "seems cleaner"
- Choose integrated structure just because it's "simpler"
- Ignore access control or compliance requirements
- Skip cross-reference strategy definition
- Create structure without team input

ALWAYS:
- Assess all organizational factors systematically
- Document rationale for structure choice
- Establish bidirectional cross-references from day one
- Create templates before first real content
- Validate with on-call engineers that structure is navigable
- Plan for structure evolution as team/system grows

REMEMBER: The structure serves engineers during incidents. If on-call engineers can't quickly find knowledge when systems are failing, the structure is wrong regardless of how elegant it seems.
</instructions>

<examples>

## Example 1: FinTech Startup (Integrated)

```
Assessment:

TEAM STRUCTURE:
Current: 15-person engineering team, no dedicated SRE
Handoffs: Engineers build → Same engineers operate → Same engineers fix
Collaboration: Daily, continuous
On-call: Weekly rotation among all engineers
→ Factor weight: INTEGRATED

TEAM SIZE:
Engineers: 15
Complexity: 5 services
Navigation: Small enough to navigate unified structure easily
Specialization: Generalists (full-stack + operations)
→ Factor weight: INTEGRATED

ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance: Basic financial regulations, no special operational restrictions
Security: Standard access controls sufficient
Permissions: All engineers need same access
Tooling: Unified GitHub for everything
→ Factor weight: INTEGRATED

KNOWLEDGE EVOLUTION:
Change frequency: Operational knowledge updates with every deployment
Coupling: Tightly coupled (infrastructure-as-code deployed with app)
Drift risk: Low (same people update both)
Synchronization: Natural (updated together)
→ Factor weight: INTEGRATED

TOOLING INTEGRATION:
Incident management: Simple Slack + runbooks
Observability: Datadog (docs in GitHub)
Development: GitHub
Overlap: Everything in GitHub
→ Factor weight: INTEGRATED

RECOMMENDATION: INTEGRATED

Rationale:
- Small team means everyone needs access to everything
- Same engineers build and operate (need unified view)
- Operational changes deploy with code (tightly coupled)
- No access control requirements justify separation

Tradeoffs Accepted:
- Slightly harder to filter "just operational" knowledge
- Mitigation: Clear operations/ subdirectory + tagging

Critical Success Factor:
Maintain clear operational knowledge organization within unified structure so on-call engineers can filter to relevant runbooks quickly.

## Example 2: Healthcare Platform (Separate with Cross-references)

```
Assessment:

TEAM STRUCTURE:
Current: 200 engineers, 20-person dedicated SRE team
Handoffs: Developers build → SRE operates → SRE pages developers for fixes
Collaboration: Regular but not continuous, defined interfaces
On-call: SRE primary, developer secondary
→ Factor weight: SEPARATE

TEAM SIZE:
Engineers: 220 total (200 dev + 20 SRE)
Complexity: 50+ services
Navigation: Separate structures easier to navigate at scale
Specialization: Dedicated SRE with specialized skills
→ Factor weight: SEPARATE

ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance: HIPAA - operational details include PHI access patterns
Security: Operational runbooks contain sensitive infrastructure details
Permissions: Different access levels (SRE vs developers)
Tooling: Separate operational tooling ecosystem
→ Factor weight: SEPARATE (STRONG)

KNOWLEDGE EVOLUTION:
Change frequency: Operational knowledge updates independently
Coupling: Loosely coupled (SRE manages infrastructure separately)
Drift risk: Moderate (separate teams must synchronize)
Synchronization: Requires explicit cross-reference maintenance
→ Factor weight: SEPARATE

TOOLING INTEGRATION:
Incident management: PagerDuty (SRE only)
Observability: Datadog + internal tools (SRE-managed)
Development: GitHub (shared)
Overlap: GitHub shared, other tools separate
→ Factor weight: SEPARATE

RECOMMENDATION: SEPARATE with explicit cross-reference maintenance

Rationale:
- HIPAA compliance requires restricted access to operational details
- Dedicated SRE team needs focused, navigable operational knowledge
- Large scale makes separate structures more manageable
- Different tooling ecosystems for dev vs operations

Tradeoffs Accepted:
- Risk of drift between development and operational knowledge
- Mitigation: Mandatory cross-reference reviews, automated link checking

Critical Success Factor:
Maintain rigorous bidirectional cross-references between memory banks with regular validation to prevent knowledge drift.

"

Validation:

✓ Chosen structure: Separate (documented rationale including HIPAA)
✓ Directory structure created: memory-bank/ and operations-memory-bank/
✓ README files explain organization and access requirements
✓ Cross-reference strategy: Explicit bidirectional mapping files

✓ Runbooks: 5 core runbooks created by SRE team
✓ Incident template created with HIPAA-compliant fields
✓ Postmortem template created
✓ Performance baseline initialized

✓ operations-memory-bank/cross-references-to-dev.md created (68 links)
✓ memory-bank/operational-overview.md created with public operational summary
✓ Bidirectional cross-references validated (automated check script)
✓ Cross-reference conventions documented in both READMEs

✓ SRE team understands structure (training session 2026-01-08)
✓ Developers understand where to find operational knowledge (doc published)
✓ On-call SRE can navigate quickly (validated in drill)
✓ Developer on-call knows escalation procedures

✓ Access controls: SRE full access, developers read-only to operations-memory-bank/
✓ PagerDuty integration links to runbooks
✓ Automated cross-reference validation in CI (weekly)
```

Why this works:
- Respects compliance boundaries while maintaining knowledge connections
- SRE gets focused operational knowledge structure
- Developers get necessary operational context without sensitive details
- Explicit cross-reference maintenance prevents drift
- Automated validation catches broken links
